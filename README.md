# pybandgap
pybandgap is a project for implementing the calculation of the bandgap in 2D structures that exhibit horizontal, vertical, and diagonal symmetry using FEniCSx.

## Prerequisites
This project requires:
- FEniCSx with complex number support.
- PyVista

## Examples
To demonstrate the usage of pybandgap, we have provided two example Jupyter notebooks:

1- [**Truss-Like Bandgap**](examples/truss-like.ipynb)

2- [**Plate-Like Bandgap**](examples/plate-like.ipynb)

2- [**mix-mesh Bandgap**](examples/mix-mesh.ipynb)
